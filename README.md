# WSL-ABA
 Developed a website using Laravel, MySQL, HTML, and CSS to register data of children with autism, as well as data of their parents and families. The website facilitates ABLLS sessions, vertical charting for progress assessment, adding preference sessions for the child, and calculating their preferences. Additionally, it allows adding training goals for the child by displaying percentage scores and percentages for each session separately. The website displays the goals log and a graphical representation of achieved goals. Moreover, it provides the ability to import reports containing all activities performed or trained by the child.
